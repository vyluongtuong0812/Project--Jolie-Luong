# About Jolie Luong
Hi guys,
I'm Tuong Vy and you can call me "Jolie". I am a final-year student with a passion for data analysis and financial modeling. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a solid foundation in both fields, which has equipped me with the necessary skills to excel as a Data Analyst or Financial Analyst. My coursework has included advanced topics such as statistics, econometrics, financial accounting, and corporate finance. Moreover, I have completed several projects that required data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using tools such as SQL and Power BI.
As a result, I am confident in my ability to work with complex datasets, identify trends, and draw insights to drive informed decision-making. I am excited to leverage my knowledge and skills to make a meaningful contribution to your organization as a Data Analyst or Financial Analyst.
